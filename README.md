IMDB Top 250 Movies Analysis as of 2021

 We are using the IMDB Top 250 Movies Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajugc/imdb-top-250-movies-dataset) which contains the top 250 rated movies on IMDB as of 2021 to analyze:
- What are the notable directors on this list?
- What genre usually gets high ratings?
- Which decade produces the most movies on this list?
- What is the average IMDB rating over time?

We are using Python and its libraries such as matplotlib, pandas, plotly, and numpy to clean and visualize the dataset.

*** Note: For our last graph, we use Plotly to display the mean rating over time, since GitHub cannot show out graph so we attach its picture to this github repo.
